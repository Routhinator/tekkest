# Tekkest: A Minetest Subgame

The year is 6025; 4 millennia after The Dark War. Humanity held onto life by hiding in caves from the fallout in the least affected areas for the first thousand years. The planet superheated after the war and then it's climate dove into an ice age that lasted for 2 millennia. The ice age has ended now. Humanity has now begun to retake the surface of their world. Evolution has taken its course, and odd creatures are scattered throughout the world. Ruins of ancient cities can be found around the world. Tarpits with fresh oil are abundant where bio waste and glacier met each other, and radioactive impact zones can still be found. Prepare yourself well adventurer, for your goal is to rebuild human civilization, and the task will not be easy.

You set off into the new world with pickaxe in hand, a few tools in your pack, and some torches to light your way.
